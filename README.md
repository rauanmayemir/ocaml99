# Ocaml99

In an attempt to learn ocaml, I started writing solutions to 99 problems.

I used this [example project](https://github.com/kmicinski/example-ocaml-merlin) as a template. The goal here is not just building 'muscle memory' for unfamiliar language, but also setting up a project environment with external dependencies, unit tests, and build tools.

It's probably better to use jbuild for real projects, but make and ocamlbuild seem to be great for learning.
